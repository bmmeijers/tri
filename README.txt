Tri - (Constrained) Delaunay Triangulation of Planar Straight Line Graphs


Installation
------------

- Download the source
- Run `python setup.py install` (or `python setup.py develop`)


Usage
-----

To triangulate a polygon with one outer and one inner shell::

    from tri import ToPointsAndSegments, triangulate
    from tri.delaunay import output_triangles, TriangleIterator

    # create points and segments for triangulation
    pts_segs = ToPointsAndSegments()
    pts_segs.add_polygon([[(0,0), (10,0), (5,10), (0,0)],
                          [(0,0), (8,2), (6,4), (5,7), (0,0)]
                          ],
                         )

    # triangulate the points and segments
    dt = triangulate(pts_segs.points, pts_segs.infos, pts_segs.segments)

    # write the output
    with open("tris.wkt", "w") as fh:
        output_triangles([t for t in TriangleIterator(dt)], fh)

The resulting file is readable with `QGIS <http://qgis.org>`_ (Add Delimited 
Text Layer).
